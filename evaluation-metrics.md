## Evaluation Metrics Glossary


### Response Completeness and Conciseness
Measures if the LLM's response fully addresses the user's query and how relevant the generated response is³.

### Text Similarity Metrics
Compares the generated text to a reference or benchmark text to assess similarity³.

### Question Answering Accuracy
Evaluates the accuracy of the LLM's responses to questions³.

### Relevance
Determines how relevant the LLM's responses are to the given prompts³.

### Hallucination Index 
Assesses the frequency of the LLM generating incorrect or nonsensical information³.

### Toxicity
Measures the level of offensive or harmful content in the LLM's responses³.

### Task-Specific Metrics
Various metrics tailored to specific tasks that the LLM performs, such as summarization, translation, etc³.

Certainly! Here's a list of 20 evaluation metrics for Large Language Models (LLMs) with brief descriptions:

### Grammar and Syntax
Evaluates the correctness of language usage in the LLM's output.

### Truthfulness 
Assesses the factual accuracy of the information provided by the LLM.

### Summary Capabilities
Measures the LLM's ability to produce concise and accurate summaries.

### Problem Solving Capabilities
Evaluates the LLM's effectiveness in solving complex tasks.

### Coherence
Checks for logical flow and consistency in the LLM's text.

### Diversity
Measures the variety in the LLM's language and content generation.

### Engagement
Assesses how engaging and interesting the LLM's responses are.

### Empathy
Evaluates the LLM's ability to respond considerately to emotional cues.

### Fairness
Measures bias in the LLM's responses.

### Robustness
Assesses the LLM's performance across a wide range of inputs and conditions.

### Scalability
