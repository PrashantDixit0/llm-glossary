### General Glossary

### LM
Language Model, a language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words.

### LLM
Large Language Model, a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabeled text using self-supervised learning.

### Generative AI
A generative artificial intelligence or generative AI / (GenAI) is a type of AI system capable of generating text, images, or other media in response to prompts. Generative AI systems use generative models such as large language models to produce data based on the training data set that was used to create them.

### Diffusion Models
Diffusion Models are a class of probabilistic generative models used in machine learning to simulate the dynamics of complex systems over time. Unlike traditional generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Diffusion Models simulate the dynamics of a stochastic process that evolves over time, rather than generating a fixed sample from a learned distribution.

### Hallucination
In artificial intelligence (AI), a hallucination or artificial hallucination (also occasionally called confabulation or delusion) is a confident response by an AI that does not seem to be justified by its training data.

### Prompt Engineering
A process of designing and constructing effective natural language prompts for use with large language models. Prompts are input patterns that are used to guide the behavior of LLMs and generate text that is relevant to a specific task or domain.

### Zero-shot Prompting/Learning
Zero-shot learning in NLP allows a pre-trained LLM to generate responses to tasks that it hasnâ€™t been specifically trained for. In this technique, the model is provided with an input text and a prompt that describes the expected output from the model in natural language.

### Context Window / Context Length
Context Window is the number of tokens that are considered when predicting the next token.
